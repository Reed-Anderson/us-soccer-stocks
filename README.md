# USMNT Stocks

The objective is to create a stock market game with American soccer players as “stocks”. A player’s value should reflect his importance to the US Men’s National Team, or his anticipated future value. Values should rise and fall with their importance or anticipated importance. Dividends shall be earned based on callups, minutes, and performances for the United States national team. Competitive games (non-friendlies) shall increase the dividends earned. The application’s users will be given a predefined number of credits upon creating their account, and will attempt to create the most valuable portfolio possible. Building wealth can be accomplished through either the “buy low, sell high” method, or by investing in players who will provide dividends.
